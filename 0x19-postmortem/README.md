Root Cause and Resolution


The root cause of the outage was a database failure. The database was unable to handle the increased load that we were experiencing at the time. We have since increased the capacity of the database to prevent this from happening again.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

Increase the capacity of the database
Add more monitoring to the database to detect failures early
Implement a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across the database servers
Implement a failover system to automatically switch to a backup database server in the event of a failure


Conclusion

We apologize for any inconvenience that the outage may have caused our users. We are committed to providing a reliable and stable service, and we are taking steps to prevent this from happening again.
